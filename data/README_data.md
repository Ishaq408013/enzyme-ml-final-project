# Data Availability

Raw FASTA sequences from UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot (E. coli K–12) are not included in this repository due to licensing restrictions.

To reproduce this project:

1. Download EC1 (oxidoreductase) and EC2 (transferase) protein sequences from UniProtKB.
2. Save the FASTA files into this `data/` directory.
3. Update paths in the notebook if needed.

This folder currently contains only project documentation.
