# AI Usage Documentation

ChatGPT (OpenAI GPT-5) was used to help revise written sections of the report, improve clarity in methodology descriptions, and assist in organizing the repository structure.  
All AI-assisted content was manually reviewed and verified by the project authors before submission.

The AI was not used to generate or modify data, code, or results. All analysis, model training, and evaluations were performed directly in the Colab notebook by the authors.

No private or sensitive data were provided to the AI system.
